# Hospitality-BI-Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard provides a data-driven solution for AtliQ Grands, a five-star hotel chain aiming to regain market share. 
üè® Project Overview
This project presents a business intelligence solution for AtliQ Grands, a prominent five-star hotel chain in India. In response to increasing competition and a decline in market share, the management at AtliQ Grands has decided to leverage data to make smarter, data-driven decisions. As a data analyst, I developed this dashboard to provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view of the hotel chain's performance, addressing the lack of an in-house data analytics team.

The dashboard, created using Power BI, transforms fragmented historical data into actionable insights, helping the revenue management team understand key trends, optimize pricing, and regain a competitive edge in the luxury and business hotel category.
